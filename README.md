# Linear Regression - Study Time vs Exam Score

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.

## 📊 Dataset
- Synthetic or real dataset containing two columns:
  - `Study Time` (hours)
  - `Exam Score`

## 🧠 Goal
Train a linear regression model to fit a line through the data and evaluate how well study time predicts exam performance.

## 🛠️ Features
- Visualizes data with scatter plot
- Fits a linear model using `scikit-learn`
- Plots the best-fit line
- Evaluates model accuracy visually and numerically
